# GarbageClassification
🗑️ Garbage Classification Using Transfer Learning (VGG16) This project uses transfer learning with the VGG16 model to classify images of garbage into 6 categories: cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, and trash. The goal is to demonstrate how pre-trained CNNs can be adapted for real-world classification tasks even with limited datasets.
